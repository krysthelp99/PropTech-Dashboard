Feature Request: Authentication Flow (Landing & Login UI)

Role: Expert Frontend Developer.

Goal: Implement the initial entry screens for the BNSC PropTech application based on the provided design concepts. The user must navigate through these screens before accessing the main Dashboard.

1. Routing & Structure

Set up React Router.

Route / (Landing Page): The default entry point.

Route /login (Login Page): Accessed via the Landing page.

Route /dashboard: Protected route. Only accessible after clicking "Login" (simulate authentication).

2. Page 1: Landing Page Design (/)

Layout: Full-screen background image.

Visuals:

Background: Use a high-quality placeholder image of "modern skyscrapers looking up" (blue sky, urban aesthetic) to match the "PropTech" theme.

Center Content:

Logo: A white circular icon containing a building symbol.

Main Title: "PropTech Developer" (Large, Bold, White text).

Subtitle: "BNSC" (Smaller, White text).

Action: A large "Get Started" button (Bright Blue bg-blue-600, rounded corners) at the bottom center. Clicking this navigates to /login.

3. Page 2: Login Page Design (/login)

Layout: Split-screen design (50% Left Image / 50% Right Form).

Left Column:

Displays the same "modern skyscrapers" image as the landing page (covering the full height).

Right Column (Form):

Header: Small Logo + "PropTech Developer" text at the top left.

Greeting: "Welcome to PropTech Developer!" (Bold, Black).

Subtext: "Please enter your login credentials to access your account." (Gray).

Input Fields:

"Email or Username" (Outlined input style).

"Password" (Outlined input style).

Controls:

Row containing: "Remember me" (Checkbox) and "Forgot Password" (Blue text link).

Primary Button: "Login" (Full width, Dark Blue bg-indigo-900). Action: Redirects user to /dashboard.

Footer: "Don't have an account? Register" (Centered at the bottom).

4. Global UI/UX Settings

Font: Use a clean Sans-Serif font (Inter or Roboto).

Responsiveness: On mobile devices, hide the "Left Image" column on the Login page and make the Form full-width.

How this integrates with your previous prompts:
Flow: It establishes the "front door" of the app.

Protection: It tells the AI to treat the Dashboard (which we designed in the previous turn) as a "Protected Route," meaning the Sidebar and Navbar won't clutter these login screens.

Visual Consistency: It explicitly asks for the "Skyscraper/Urban" imagery to match the screenshots you provided.
