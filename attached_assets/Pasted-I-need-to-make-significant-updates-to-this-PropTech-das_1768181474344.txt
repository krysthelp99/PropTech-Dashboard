I need to make significant updates to this PropTech dashboard. Please implement the following features while maintaining the existing design system, color palette, and component style.

Here are the specific requirements:

### 1. Authentication Flow (Login + MFA)
* Create a new Login Page as the entry point.
* **Step 1:** User enters Username and Password.
* **Step 2 (MFA):** Upon submission, show a second screen/modal asking for an MFA (Multi-Factor Authentication) code.
* *Note:* For now, please implement the **UI flow and frontend logic only** (you can mock the successful login).

### 2. Collapsible Sidebar
* Update the main navigation sidebar to be collapsible.
* Add a toggle button (hamburger menu or arrow icon) at the top or bottom of the sidebar.
* When collapsed, show only the icons. When expanded, show icons + text labels.
* Ensure the main content area resizes responsively when the menu is collapsed.

### 3. Role-Based Dashboards (Super Admin vs. Admin)
I need the system to handle two distinct user roles. Please refactor the dashboard routing or state to support this:

**A. Super Admin View:**
* Has access to all existing features.
* **New Feature:** Add a specific "User Approval" page or section.
* This page should display a table of new admins who have requested access.
* Include columns for: Name, Email, Date Requested, and Status.
* Include action buttons: "Approve" and "Reject".

**B. Admin View:**
* This dashboard looks exactly like the Super Admin dashboard.
* **Restriction:** They CANNOT see the "User Approval" page.
* Their primary focus is the existing functionality (updating available properties).

### Implementation Plan:
1.  Modify the Layout to handle the collapsible state.
2.  Create the Login/MFA screens.
3.  Create the "User Approval" component (Table with dummy data for now).
4.  Implement a mock state (e.g., `userRole = 'super_admin'`) to conditionally render the "User Approval" menu item based on the role.

Please prioritize keeping the UI clean and matching the current "prop-tech" aesthetic.
