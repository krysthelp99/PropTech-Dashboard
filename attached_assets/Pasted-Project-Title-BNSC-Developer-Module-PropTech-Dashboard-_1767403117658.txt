Project Title: BNSC Developer Module - PropTech Dashboard

Role: Act as an expert Full-Stack Developer and UI/UX Designer.

Goal: Build a responsive Developer Dashboard for a PropTech platform called "BNSC." The dashboard facilitates a specific workflow: initially "blind" (privacy-focused) for monitoring, shifting to "verification-heavy" for closing deals.

Tech Stack:

Frontend: React, Vite, Tailwind CSS.

Components: Shadcn UI (or generic accessible components), Lucide React (icons).

Charts: Recharts (for analytics).

Navigation: Sidebar navigation with React Router.

Core Page Requirements & Features:

1. Dashboard Overview (Home)

Metric Cards: Display high-level stats: "Active Projects," "Pending Verifications," "Total Units Sold," and "Monthly Engagement."

Action Required Section: A prominent list of items requiring immediate attention (e.g., "3 SPAs pending verification").

2. Project & Data Management (The 'Input' Phase)

Project Upload Portal: A multi-step form to input project details, pricing, unit mix, and rebate structures.

USP Editor: A dedicated section where developers can define and update "Unique Selling Propositions" (key differentiators).

Inventory Management: A table view showing "Sold" vs. "Available" units with a quarterly "Occupancy Tracker" input field.

3. Verification & Compliance (The 'Action' Phase)

Document Verification Portal: A secure interface to view uploaded PDFs (simulate with placeholders) for SPAs and Bank Letters of Offer.

Dual Confirmation System: Implement a specific workflow where the developer must click to digitally acknowledge: "Booking," "Buyer Identity," and "Commission %."

Timestamp Logic: visually display two timestamps next to every action: the "System Timestamp" and the "Developer Action Timestamp" to prevent backdating.

4. Analytics & Market Intelligence (The 'Wait' Phase)

Engagement Dashboard: Show anonymized metrics (e.g., "25 Agents viewed this project") using line charts. Important: Do NOT show agent names here.

Market Comparison Tool: Create a section that simulates synced data from external sources (iProperty, PropertyGuru) comparing Yield, Occupancy, and Price PSF.

Buyer Data Unlock: Implement a UI state where buyer contact details are blurred/locked by default and only "Unlock" after the Booking Confirmation status is set to true.

5. Financial Oversight

Payout Confirmation: A list of staged projects (e.g., Stage 2a) with buttons to "Approve Disbursement."

Rebate Logic View: A read-only view showing how the AI matches their project to buyers based on loan margins (visualize this as a simple match-score card).

UI/UX Design Guidelines:

Theme: Professional, clean, and trustworthy (Blues, Greys, and White).

Privacy Indicators: Use visual lock icons 🔒 on any screen displaying buyer data until the "Unlock" phase is triggered.

Responsiveness: Ensure the sidebar collapses on mobile.

Start by generating the project structure and the main Dashboard shell.
